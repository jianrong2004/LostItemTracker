## Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK** 3.7.2 or higher  
  [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **Firebase project** with:
    - Authentication (Email/Password)
    - Cloud Firestore
- **FlutterFire CLI** (for Firebase config generation)

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd lost_item_tracker
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase configuration

The app uses `lib/firebase_options.dart` for Firebase configuration. To set up or update it:

1. Install FlutterFire CLI:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```

2. Log in to Firebase and select your project:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   flutterfire configure
   ```

3. For **Android**, ensure `google-services.json` is present at `android/app/google-services.json`. FlutterFire typically places it there; otherwise, download it from the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and add it manually.

4. For **iOS**, ensure the `GoogleService-Info.plist` is added to your Xcode project (usually via FlutterFire or manual addition).

### 4. Firestore rules and indexes

Configure Firestore security rules and indexes as required by the app. Refer to your Firebase project setup for production rules.

## Running the app

```bash
flutter run
```

Choose your target device (Android, iOS, web, Windows, macOS) when prompted. For Android emulator or device:

```bash
flutter run -d android
```
